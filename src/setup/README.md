# Interactive CLI Project Setup

## Purpose

It's easy to get overwhelmed whenever you start a new project.

_What file structue do I use? What linting rules do I care about, if any? I probably should make sure I have a nice commit history..._

Before you know it, you've spent 3+ hours setting up a project, and you haven't even added basic functionality for what you originally wanted to accomplish. We've all been there.

This is why starter templates are great. They're typically easy to use and they enable you to quickly start coding. But... if you're anything like me, you're picky. You probably have personal preferences as to how your project should be setup.

This project is already set up and ready to use with my favorite specifications. But everyone is different. So I've created an interactive CLI setup option that allows you to make changes to the project setup **quickly** and **easily**. No more spending hours reading articles and documentation. Simply take 10-15 minutes using my project setup tool, and this starter will soon reflect exactly what YOU want (as it should!).

## How to use

After creating your own project from your terminal using the Gatsby CLI:

```
gatsby new your-project-name https://github.com/meredithmurfin/customizable-gatsby-starter.git
```

Run the following command to start the interactive setup tool:

```
yarn setup
```

The interactive CLI will ask you a series of questions regarding your project preferences related to linting, committing, and other general configurations. After setup is complete, the files and dependencies related to this setup process will be removed from your project.
